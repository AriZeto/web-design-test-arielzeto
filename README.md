# Introduction - Welcome to EasyBrew!:

The purpose of this test is to evaluate my skills in HTML, CSS, and modern CSS practices - such as utilizing flexbox or grid. For the purposes of this test, I used flexbox.

The test asks us to make a landing page for a fictional product, or a service, such as e-commerce.

This web app I designed is based off of a fictional Coffee pour-over, called the `EasyBrew`.
The EasyBrew is designed as must have, sleek, and green (made with recyclable materials) portable coffee pour-over, crafted with care for all coffee lovers!

# Objective:

- **Objective:** Design and code a landing page that adheres to a brief provided
  within the repository.
- **Design Brief:** Include specifics like:
- Layout (header, navigation, content area, footer).
- Required sections (hero section, features, testimonials, CTA).
- Must be responsive across different device sizes.
- Use of specific fonts or color schemes (if applicable).
- A brief about the fictional product or service.

# How does 'EasyBrew' pass the objectives listed above?:

There exists a single-page landing page for the fictional product, the EasyBrew.

There is content, a hero, call to action (which pops up a modal), navigation, and a footer.

In addition to those required sections, there are also a testimonials, features, and contact section.

The website itself utilized Flexbox, and I did place a few media queries as well, it is response and works on mobile, tablet size devices, and typical monitor sizes.

I utilized the popular `Roboto` font from Google Fonts.

I did my best to sticl to this **[this beautiful color scheme located here](https://colorhunt.co/palette/fdf7f48eb486997c70685752)!**

There is an brief information about the fictional product within the `about`, `call to action` (first card you see, that is interactable), as well as the `modal` that opens when the card is selected!

# Modal?:

I implemented a modal utilizing CSS. You click the first card you see on the page, and a modal will appear. I typically would design this in TypeScript with React, but I did not utilize TypeScript.

# Did you use any TypeScript libraries such as 'React'?:

Nope. However, I love the React library, and it is my primary frontend library I utilize when writing web applications. I think it's really powerful, and I really like the process of `state management` that it has popularized.

# So...Is there any TypeScript implementation?:

No, similarily to `React` (or any frontend libraries), I decided to not implement TypeScript as the test specifically called for just HTML and CSS. I do know TypeScript, and I prefer to make interactive web applications utilizing it! :)

This test just uses **HTML, CSS, and Flexbox**.

# Project Files:

- index.html , contains all HTML markup
- styles.css, contains all CSS styling, most with flexbox.
- Assets folder, contains a couple of images related to coffee/pour-overs that I got for free on `Unsplash.com`.
- The Assets folder contains an SVG I obtained for free online from `SVGRepo.com`, to which I utilized as a navigation banner image.

# Implementation:

- Utilizes HTML
- Utilizes CSS
- Utilizes the popular Flexbox styling for responiveness
- Contains media queries for responsiveness
- Contains several hover effects and animations
- Includes a modal for interaction

# Note about the `Contact Section`:

This is setup as a form, where form submissions would be sent off to a particular page.
However, considering that this is not a website meant for deployment, the actual form submission for `contact` goes no where. The submission button for it is disabled.

# Enjoy! :)
